I am a former quant researcher at Vatic Labs looking to work in ML research and engineering. You can find me on <a href = "https://github.com/hollymandel">github</a> or <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-mandel-a0b858220">LinkedIn</a> or take a look at my <a href = "https://hollymandel.github.io/resume_public.pdf">resume</a>. 

## Previous Work
For my first year at Vatic I did alpha research on the statistical arbitrage team. In the second year I switched to the high-frequency trading team, where I designed and built a production pipeline to automate a decision that had previously been done ad-hoc. 

Before Vatic I did my <a href = "arXiv:2206.09792">PhD in Mathematics</a> at Berkeley with <a href = "https://math.berkeley.edu/~sosun/">Song Sun</a> on complex geometry, a field that combines algebraic geometry and differential geometry. I studied what negative Kahler-Einstein metrics look like as the underlying surfaces are deformed into singularities.

For my undergraduate research and for a year after graduating, I studied the neuroscience of motion detection in fruit flies with <a href = "https://clarklab.yale.edu">Damon Clark</a> at Yale. We used genetic tools and fluorescent imaging to see what role individual neuron types play in the motion detection circuit. 

## Personal
Outside of work I like reading books and running up hills. I like introspective books like To The Lighthouse and In Search of Lost Time and long character-driven books like Kristin Lavransdatter and Middlemarch. My upcoming races are <a href = "https://brazenracing.com/doubledipsea/">Double Dipsea</a> and <a href = "https://runsra.org/california-international-marathon/">CIM</a>. 

## Send me podcast recommendations
I am always looking for podcast recommendations. Some of my current favorites are Acquired, Money Stuff, Hard Fork, Planet Money, and The Intelligence (daily news).
