I am a former quant researcher at Vatic Labs interested in machine learning and data engineering. You can find me on <a href = "https://github.com/hollymandel">github</a> or <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollymandel">LinkedIn</a>.

## Previous Work
During my first year at Vatic I did alpha research on the statistical arbitrage team. Then I switched to the high-frequency trading team, where I designed and built a production pipeline to automate an important execution decision.

Before Vatic I did my PhD in Mathematics at Berkeley with <a href = "https://math.berkeley.edu/~sosun/">Song Sun</a> on complex geometry, a field that combines algebraic geometry and differential geometry. I studied what negative Kahler-Einstein metrics look like as the underlying surfaces are deformed into singularities.

For my undergraduate research and for a year after graduating, I studied the neuroscience of vision in fruit flies with <a href = "https://clarklab.yale.edu">Damon Clark</a> at Yale. We used genetic tools and fluorescent imaging to see what role individual neuron types play in the motion detection circuit. 

## Personal
Outside of work I like reading books and running up hills. Here is a photo of me <a href = "enjoyment.jpg">enjoying</a> Double Dipsea in August 2024.
